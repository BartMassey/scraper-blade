# Scraper Blade
Copyright &copy; 2014 Bart Massey

This repo contains [FreeCAD](http://freecadweb.org) and
[STL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_%28file_format%29) files
for a straight-edged scraper blade for a Chicago Electric
(Harbor Freight)
[67537](http://www.harborfreight.com/variable-speed-multifunction-power-tool-67537.html)
"Variable Speed Oscillating Multifunction Power Tool".

My intent is to 3D-print this part and use it for removing
labels from wine and liquor bottles so that they can be
relabeled. The part hasn't yet been tried, and will probably
need some adjustment. It may not work at all.
