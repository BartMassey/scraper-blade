# Scraper Blade
Copyright &copy; 2014 Bart Massey

This repo contains [FreeCAD](http://freecadweb.org) and
[STL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_%28file_format%29) files
for a straight-edged scraper blade for a Chicago Electric
(Harbor Freight)
[67537](http://www.harborfreight.com/variable-speed-multifunction-power-tool-67537.html)
"Variable Speed Oscillating Multifunction Power Tool".

My intent is to print this part in ABS and use it for
removing labels from wine and liquor bottles so that they
can be relabeled. The part hasn't yet been tried, and will
probably need some adjustment. It may not work at all.

The four-hole arbor (as opposed to the 12-hole arbor on
standard blades) is the result of FreeCAD constraint solver
fail, and should probably be fixed, but for this application
I didn't much care.
